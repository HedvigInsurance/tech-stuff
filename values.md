# Tech values

## As Hedvig developers, we ask ourselves:

- Is whatever I develop stable enough that I can sleep?
  - When building stuff we don't aim for perfection, but things should be stable enough that we have piece of mind
    and don't worry that the things we build break in the middle of the night.
- Does it scale well?
  - Again, although we don't build for perfection we build in a sustainable and maintainable way.
- Do I loop in my team enough?
  - Collective intelligence is a big part of Hedvig's values and we avoid knowledge silos. Looping in the team
    doesn't necesarily mean running everything by them, but we avoid knowledge silos and cowboy decisions.

## As Hedvig developers, when developing, we:

- Use automatic testing, and use it lagom
  - Usually automated tests saves us a lot of time and effort, but we recognise when it's time to give up writing
    that perfect test.
- Make small iterations
  - By iterating small we build amazing things, by failing often and fixing fast. We value small and undoable
    releases over big bang bombs.
- Refactor often, and refactor early
  - Fail often, fix fast, and don't be afraid to fix what aint broken â„¢
- Have fun, but stay true to our goals
  - We value trying new tech and toying with projects, and know it's in Hedvig's best interest to stay on the
    cutting edge, while still staying productive.

## As Hedvig developers, when selecting new tech, we:

- Talk to our team about it
- Choose the right abstraction fit
- Aren't afraid to try new things, but do __evaluate__
- Value battle-tested tech over new and fancy features
