# Tech values

## As Hedvig developers, we ask ourselves:

- Is whatever I develop stable enough that I can sleep at night?
  - When building stuff we don't aim for perfection, but things should be stable enough that we have piece of mind
    and don't worry about downtime in the middle of the night.
- Does it scale?
  - Again, although we don't build for perfection. We build in a sustainable and maintainable way. Sometimes, even
    small adjustments can have a big impact
- Do I loop in my team enough?
  - Collective thinking is a big part of Hedvig's values and we avoid knowledge silos. Looping in the team
    doesn't necesarily mean running everything by them, but we avoid knowledge silos and cowboy decisions.
  - A good rule of thumb is to always have at least two people knowing about a concept or technology,
    although of course we understand that it's not always possible.
  - We live this value by practicing for example pair/mob programming and code reviews.

## As Hedvig developers, when developing, we:

- Use automatic testing, and use it lagom
  - Automated tests saves us a lot of time and effort, but we recognize when it's time to give up writing
    that perfect test.
- Make small iterations
  - By iterating small we build amazing stuff! We fail often and fix it fast. We value small and undoable
    releases over big bang bombs. While we value it, we also understand that in some cases its hard to escape
    large releases, though.
- Refactor often, and refactor early
  - Fail often, fix fast and do _not_ live by the old quote "if it ain't brok, don't fix it"
  - Value the boy scout rule (leave things prettier than you found them)
- Have fun, but stay true to our goals
  - We value trying new tech and toying with projects, and know it's in Hedvig's best interest to stay on the
    cutting edge, while still staying productive.

## As Hedvig developers, when selecting new tech, we:

- Talk to our team about it
- Choose the right abstraction fit - we find the right balance between low and high level libraries and technoloies
  based on what is better for the use case
- Aren't afraid to try new things, but do __evaluate__
- Value tech that is battle-tested over tech that is new and shiny. Although we value it, that does not mean
  it's our only path
  
## As Hedvig developers, when working in sprints, we:

- Do not consider estimates as deadlines
  - Estimates are a way for us to communicate an educated guess of time we'll spend, nothing else
- Finish leftovers from the previous sprint first
  - That is, if the leftovers are unavoidable and we still want to finish them
- Work without deadlines
  - Unless there is no way to avoid a deadline
- Finish the MVP first if a deadline is set
  - We finalise the delivery as a whole after
- Want to have dependencies done before starting implementation
- Split up projects into small batch deliveries
  - And with that avoid big bang project releases 
- Do not jeopardise quality
  - We would rather cut scope, spend more time on the issue or, if applicable, include more developers
