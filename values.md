# Tech values

## As Hedvig developers, we ask ourselves:

- Is whatever I develop stable enough that I can sleep?
- Does it scale well?
- Do I loop in my team enough?

## As Hevig developers, when developing, we:

- Use automatic testing, and use it lagom
- Make small iterations
- Refactor often, and refactor early
- Have fun, but stay true to our goals

## As Hedvig developers, when selecting new tech, we:

- Talk to our team about it
- Choose the right abstraction fit
- Aren't afraid to try new things, but do __evaluate__
- Value battle-tested tech over new and fancy features
